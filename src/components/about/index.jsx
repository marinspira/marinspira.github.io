                <span>
                    My name is Maria Eduarda. I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but I love traveling and have visited over six countries so far.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I've been passionate about programming since I was 12, when I decided to create a blog about books and movies. Since then, I've never stopped developing websites and systems. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am currently studying Software Engineering, have a degree in Digital Marketing, and I love acquiring new knowledge, exploring new places, and creating things that bring memorable experiences to people.
